For the past few decades, we have seen our elders fall prey to a viscous illness, known as Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, it is a form of a neurodegenerative disorder which will progress with age, and make the complications worse. It usually attacks people around th e age of sixty. The characterization of the illness is as such, it leads to a reduction in dopamine producing cells of the brain. This leads to symptoms like stiffness, tremors, and impaired balance . Even today, scientists have been unable to find out what exactly causes this disease. Some believe that genetics, and environmental triggers have a role to play in this. Although, this disease is incurable and chronic once set in. There are medicines and procedures which can somewhat alleviate the symptoms and provide temporary relief. This may help improve the quality of life a little bit, but sometimes, the complications of the illness can prove to be fatal.

Our project aims to mitigate the threat of this disease by using A NOVEL MIX OF ENSEMBLE TECHNOQUES, SUCH AS STACKING AND VOTING CLASSIFIER to predict this disease. We are using multiple attributes in order to analyze and predict the degree of threat an individual faces of acquiring this dangerous disease. We hope to help million's take pre emptive action and save themselves.
